## Getting Started

Install the dependencies

```
npm install
```

Start a development server by running

```
npm run dev
```

Or, start a production server by running

```
npm run start:db
npm run build
```

By default, the app will run on http://localhost:3000 and the `json-server` will run on http://localhost:3100. To change this, modify `.env`.
